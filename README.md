luis_practice
=============

A place to use for practicing/exercising purposes. Think of it as Luis' coding dojo and also an artifact to experiment with/learn about git and github.

The Puzzles folder contains various C# projects. These are solutions to common interview questions and experiments solving them. Later on, it might be interesting to put solutions to project euler problems within those.
